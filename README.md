RoR test
========

Conversion of the university group project. Originally used django. I've redid it in Rails just to see what the whole framework is about. 

#### Some notes:

* as this was previously a group project some parts of the code (mainly css) are terrible
* not that much time was actually spend adding functionality - this was just a test app
* I've really enjoyed the fact that scaffolding creates test scripts when everything is already configured - awesome !
* rails on windows sucks. It is not worth comparing *this* to Node, it just does not work. **Why executing simple one-line test takes 20s ?!**
* rails on windows does not sucks if You use it through linux virtual machine. **Vagrant !**
* Vagrant & Chef included. It is actually quite awesome to use now
